# A *PDF* Authoring tool

An easy-to-use *GUI* Application that places *PDF* elements (Text, Forms, Images etc...) into a blank Document.

## This Project consists of :

1) a *PDF specification* *parser* written from scratch in *Tcl/Tk*
2) a *GUI* that enables easy placement and *'configurement'* of such elements of the *specification* into the new Document.
